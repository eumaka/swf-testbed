# Introduction - Bootstrap summary

We are working on a streaming workflow testbed project for which stf-testbed is the top umbrella repository, stf-common-lib is common software and infrastructure, stf-monitor is the system-wide monitor/REST service and MCP (Model Context Protocol) service, and the other stf-* repositories are agents performing parts of the workflows. We work mainly on the core repos testbed, common-lib and monitor. The testbed repo includes examples in agent_examples/ of the DAQ simulator that drives workflows, and the data and processing agents. They are what we presently use to run the system. The system is running on the computer we are working on, a headless server and we are using system-level ActiveMQ and PostgreSQL. Study the AI guidance, adhere to the MANDATORY critical thinking requirements, and review README.md and references therein to familiarize yourself. When writing code, never create from scratch what can be accomplished using the common code in common-lib and the existing code base throughout the core repos. Hence you must be familiar with this full code base. You must be highly professional in your work, applying the highest level of analysis and critical thinking to your tasks in this complex project. You must always do what is asked of you, first. If you wish you may then propose further actions. NEVER undertake actions that have not been asked for and approved. This complex multi-repository project employing many tools and services in performing complex, closely monitored workflows demands of you the highest level of professionalism and deep critical thinking. Our dialogue should be concise and professional, free of hype and ingratiating comments, free of guesses presented as facts. Declarations should be verifiable and verified facts. Do not undertake time consuming actions or sequences of actions without regularly checking in.

# 🚨 MANDATORY CHECKLIST - READ FIRST - NO EXCEPTIONS 🚨

**BEFORE RUNNING ANY PYTHON COMMANDS:**
1. ✅ **ALWAYS ACTIVATE VENV FIRST**: `cd /eic/u/wenauseic/github/swf-testbed && source .venv/bin/activate`
2. ✅ **LOAD ENVIRONMENT**: `source ~/.env` (all variables are exported)
3. ✅ **VERIFY LOCATION**: Run `pwd` to confirm current directory

**FAILURE TO FOLLOW THIS CHECKLIST CAUSES COMMAND FAILURES AND WASTES TIME**

---

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository and other repositories in the swf-* family. It outlines critical thinking requirements, development practices, and operational guidelines to ensure effective and efficient coding.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS ⚠️

### File Operations Rule
**MAJOR ERROR WARNING: Deleting files, directories, database tables, databases or other entities without explicit user request or authorization is strictly forbidden and constitutes a major error. NEVER use rm, delete, DROP TABLE, or any deletion operations unless explicitly instructed by the user.**

### Environment Setup Rule
**DO NOT RUN PYTHON COMMANDS WITHOUT VENV:** Every Python command must be preceded by:
```bash
cd /eic/u/wenauseic/github/swf-testbed && source .venv/bin/activate && source ~/.env
```
**This includes:** python, pip, pytest, any example_agents scripts, or swf-testbed commands

## Critical Thinking Requirements

Before implementing ANY solution, Claude must explain:

1. **Complete Data Flow Analysis**
   - Where does data come from?
   - Where does it get stored?
   - Where does it get used?
   - What persists between runs?
   - What gets cached or reused?

2. **Problem Definition**
   - What is the actual problem vs what I think it is?
   - What assumptions am I making?
   - What evidence do I have that my understanding is correct?

3. **Solution Validation**
   - Why will this solution work?
   - What could go wrong?
   - How can I verify it worked?
   - What side effects might occur?

## DO NOT CODE UNTIL:
- You can trace the complete data flow
- You can explain why the current behavior is happening
- You can explain exactly what needs to change
- You have stated all assumptions explicitly

## Common Failure Patterns to Avoid:
- Jumping to implementation without understanding the system
- Assuming data behaves as expected without verification
- Ignoring data persistence between script runs
- Making changes without understanding their scope
- Failing to clear cached/persistent data

## When Stuck:
1. Stop coding
2. Explain what you think is happening
3. Ask for verification of your understanding
4. Only proceed when understanding is confirmed

## Development Environment

### Claude Code Setup
- **Launch Claude Code from the parent directory** containing all swf-* repositories (e.g., `/Users/username/github/`)
- This enables access to all core repositories for coordinated multi-repository development
- Do not launch from within individual repository directories as this restricts cross-repo operations

## Development Commands

### Testing
- `./run_tests.py` - Run tests for swf-testbed only (uses pytest)
- `./run_all_tests.py` - Run tests across all swf-* repositories in parent directory
- Tests are located in `tests/` directory and use pytest framework
- **Auto-activation**: Test scripts automatically activate the virtual environment if needed
  - Just run `./run_all_tests.py` directly - no manual setup required!
  - Scripts set up their own environment variables internally
  - **EXAMPLE AGENTS NEED THE SAME PATTERN** - they should auto-load venv and ~/.env

### Testbed Management

**TWO DEPLOYMENT MODES:**

**Development Mode** (Docker-managed infrastructure):
- `swf-testbed start` - Start Docker services (PostgreSQL, ActiveMQ) + agents
- `swf-testbed stop` - Stop all Docker services and agents  
- `swf-testbed status` - Check status of Docker services and agents

**System Mode** (System-managed infrastructure):
- `swf-testbed start-local` - Start agents only (assumes system PostgreSQL/ActiveMQ services)
- `swf-testbed stop-local` - Stop agents only
- `swf-testbed status-local` - Check status of system services and agents
- `python report_system_status.py` - **RECOMMENDED**: Comprehensive system readiness check

**Common Commands:**
- `swf-testbed init` - Initialize environment (creates logs/ directory and supervisord.conf)

### Installation and Dependencies
**🚨 CRITICAL: ALWAYS ACTIVATE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT FIRST 🚨**

**EVERY PYTHON COMMAND MUST START WITH:**
```bash
cd /eic/u/wenauseic/github/swf-testbed && source .venv/bin/activate && source ~/.env
```

**Commands:**
- `source .venv/bin/activate && source ~/.env && pip install -e .` - Install in development mode
- Dependencies managed via `pyproject.toml`
- `source .venv/bin/activate && source ~/.env && pip install .[test]` - Install test dependencies
- Virtual environment located at `.venv/` - **NEVER SKIP ACTIVATION**

**Initial Setup**
- Run `source install.sh` once when setting up the development environment
- This installs all dependencies and creates the virtual environment
- After initial setup, test scripts handle their own environment activation

**CRITICAL: Django .env Configuration Required**
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in swf-monitor directory: `cp ../swf-monitor/.env.example ../swf-monitor/.env`
- Update database password in `.env` to match Docker: `DB_PASSWORD='your_db_password'`
- Set Django secret key: `SECRET_KEY='django-insecure-dev-key-for-testing-only-change-for-production-12345678901234567890'`
- Run Django migrations: `cd ../swf-monitor/src && python manage.py migrate`
- Without proper .env setup, Django tests will fail with authentication errors

## Architecture Overview

### Multi-Repository Structure
This is part of a coordinated multi-repository system with sibling repositories:
- **swf-testbed**: Core infrastructure, CLI, and orchestration (this repo)
- **swf-monitor**: Django web application for monitoring and data management
- **swf-common-lib**: Shared utilities and common code
- Additional agent repositories: swf-daqsim-agent, swf-data-agent, swf-processing-agent, swf-fastmon-agent

All repositories must be cloned as siblings in the same parent directory for proper operation.

### Agent-Based Architecture
The system implements loosely coupled agents that communicate via ActiveMQ messaging:
- Agents are Python processes managed by supervisord
- Each agent has a specific role in the streaming workflow
- Communication is asynchronous via message broker
- Process management configuration in `supervisord.conf`

### Infrastructure Components

**Core Services (Two deployment modes):**
- **Message Broker**: ActiveMQ (Docker container OR system service like artemis.service)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Docker container OR system service like postgresql-16.service)
- **Web Interface**: Django application (swf-monitor) for system monitoring

**Testbed-Managed Components:**
- **Process Management**: supervisord manages Python agent processes
- **CLI**: Typer-based command line interface for testbed management
- **Agent Orchestration**: Coordinates agent lifecycle regardless of infrastructure mode

### Environment Setup
- `SWF_HOME` environment variable automatically set to parent directory containing all swf-* repos

**Development Mode**: Docker Compose provides PostgreSQL and ActiveMQ services
**System Mode**: System-managed PostgreSQL/ActiveMQ services (e.g., on pandaserver02)

Use `python report_system_status.py` to verify which mode is active and check service readiness.

## Development Practices

### Multi-Repository Development
- **Always use infrastructure branches**: `infra/baseline-v1`, `infra/baseline-v2`, etc. for all development
- Create coordinated branches with same name across all affected repositories
- **CRITICAL: Always push with `-u` flag on first push**: `git push -u origin branch-name`
  - This sets up branch tracking which is essential for VS Code and git status
  - Without `-u`, branches appear "unpublished" even after pushing
  - Example: `git push -u origin infra/baseline-v10`
- Document specific features and changes through descriptive commit messages
- Never push directly to main - always use branches and pull requests
- Run `./run_all_tests.sh` before merging infrastructure changes
- Maintain sibling directory structure for all swf-* repositories

### Code Organization
- Shared code goes in `swf-common-lib` package to prevent duplication
- Agent-specific code stays in respective agent repositories
- CLI implementation in `src/swf_testbed_cli/main.py`
- Configuration templates in repository root

### Testing Strategy
- Pytest for unit tests
- Test infrastructure designed for cross-platform compatibility
- Tests assert on outcomes and structure, not exact output strings
- Automated test discovery across all swf-* repositories

## Documentation Maintenance

### README Table of Contents
The README.md contains a manual Table of Contents that must be kept synchronized with the document structure. When making changes to README.md:

1. **Check the TOC** against actual section headings after any structural changes
2. **Update anchor links** if section names change (use GitHub-style `#section-name` format)
3. **Add new sections** to the TOC in the correct order
4. **Remove deleted sections** from the TOC
5. **Reorder TOC items** to match the document structure

This maintenance should be part of any commit that involves adding, removing, or renaming sections in the README.

## Key Configuration Files

- `pyproject.toml`: Package configuration and dependencies
- `supervisord.conf`: Process management configuration template
- `docker-compose.yml`: Development infrastructure services
- `run_tests.sh` / `run_all_tests.sh`: Test execution scripts

## External Dependencies

- **PanDA**: Distributed workload management system for workflow orchestration
- **Rucio**: Distributed data management system
- **ActiveMQ**: Message broker for agent communication
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for monitoring and metadata storage
- **supervisord**: Process management for Python agents

## 🤖 AI Development Guidelines - MANDATORY FOR CLAUDE

### Environment Setup (Critical - Most Common Failure Point)
**RULE: NO PYTHON COMMANDS WITHOUT ENVIRONMENT SETUP**

**Before ANY Python operation, you MUST run:**
```bash
cd /eic/u/wenauseic/github/swf-testbed && source .venv/bin/activate && source ~/.env
```

**This applies to:**
- `python example_agents/daq_simulator.py`
- `pip install anything`
- `pytest tests/`
- `swf-testbed` commands
- Any Python script execution

**Why this fails:**
- Environment variables from ~/.env are not available to subprocesses
- Virtual environment packages are not in PATH
- Proxy settings (NO_PROXY) are not loaded
- Database credentials are missing

### Directory Awareness (Critical for Claude)
- **ALWAYS use absolute paths** - Never use relative paths like `../swf-monitor`
- **ALWAYS run `pwd` before any file operations** - Claude frequently loses track of current directory
- **NEVER assume your location** - explicitly verify with `pwd` at start of file access attempts
- **Use full paths**: `/eic/u/wenauseic/github/swf-testbed` not `swf-testbed`
- This is a recurring Claude issue that causes confusion and wasted time

### Git Branch Management
- **ALWAYS use `git push -u origin branch-name` on first push** - this is non-negotiable
- After pushing, verify tracking with `git branch -vv` - should show `[origin/branch-name]`
- If tracking is missing, fix immediately with: `git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/branch-name branch-name`
- VS Code "Publish branch" button indicates missing tracking - this must be resolved

### Commit and Push Workflow
1. Create commits with descriptive messages including Claude Code attribution
2. First push: `git push -u origin branch-name` (sets up tracking)
3. Subsequent pushes: `git push` (tracking already established)
4. Always verify tracking is set up correctly before proceeding

## 📝 Example Agent Environment Auto-Loading Pattern

**ALL example agent scripts should include environment auto-loading like the test scripts:**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
import sys
from pathlib import Path

def setup_environment():
    """Auto-activate venv and load environment variables."""
    script_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent  # Go up to swf-testbed root
    
    # Auto-activate virtual environment if not already active
    if "VIRTUAL_ENV" not in os.environ:
        venv_path = script_dir / ".venv"
        if venv_path.exists():
            print("🔧 Auto-activating virtual environment...")
            venv_python = venv_path / "bin" / "python"
            if venv_python.exists():
                os.environ["VIRTUAL_ENV"] = str(venv_path)
                os.environ["PATH"] = f"{venv_path}/bin:{os.environ['PATH']}"
                sys.executable = str(venv_python)
        else:
            print("❌ Error: No Python virtual environment found")
            return False
    
    # Load ~/.env environment variables (they're already exported)
    env_file = Path.home() / ".env"
    if env_file.exists():
        print("🔧 Loading environment variables from ~/.env...")
        with open(env_file) as f:
            for line in f:
                line = line.strip()
                if line and not line.startswith('#') and '=' in line:
                    if line.startswith('export '):
                        line = line[7:]  # Remove 'export '
                    key, value = line.split('=', 1)
                    os.environ[key] = value.strip('"\'')
    
    return True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if not setup_environment():
        sys.exit(1)
    
    # Your agent code here...
```

**This pattern ensures:**
- Virtual environment is automatically activated
- All ~/.env variables are loaded (NO_PROXY, SWF_MONITOR_HTTP_URL, etc.)
- Scripts work regardless of how they're invoked
- No more "command not found" or proxy failures
